# Chapter 1: GPIO Output Push-Pull

## What is GPIO?

GPIO stands for General-purpose input/output.

For example, not only can you control a GPIO pin to output a voltage you set through a program you write, but you can also read the voltage value of this pin at this time.

That's the main function of GPIO Pin, and the specific principle of GPIO will be presented in subsequent chapters.

## The basic principle of LED

LED stands for light-emitting diode. Nowadays, most lights you can see are LED.

### Structure and composition of LED

LEDs have two poles - positive and negative
